This is a fanfic between Oski, the official mascot of UC Berkeley, and Tree, the mascot for Stanford. Although UC Berkeley is the number one public university in the world, Oski-chan still holds some jealousy towards Tree-senpai for being such a successful private school. The scene begins with Oski and Tree sitting together on top of The Big C in Berkeley, having a romantic conversation at sunset. Oski-chan is leaning on Tree's shoulder in the twilight.

Oski: Tree, would you please scratch my tummy for me?

Tree: *smirking* I'm sorry, I can't help you.

Oski: Huh? What do you mean? Please, scratch my tummy Tree senpai... or else! *clinging to Tree*

Tree: *sigh* Oh, okay then. If it will make you stop acting like this. *leans over and scratches Oski's belly*

Oski: *squeaks in happiness* Thank you Tree-senpai!

Tree: Yeah, whatever. Now let me go, we are suppose to be meeting up with Leland Stanford for our Cal-Stanford football game tomorrow at the Big Game.

Oski: Aww, but Tree-senpai... do you really have to go? Don't you want to hang around a little longer with me?

Tree: *glaring at Oski* If I don't meet up with Mr. Stanford now, then who will? Hmm? *leaves Oski alone on top of The Big C and walks away towards the Sproul Plaza area*

Oski: Tree-senpai! Don't leave me like this! T-T I want to be with you so bad... *leaves depressed*

Tree: *comes back and sits down by Oski* Listen here, if I wanted you to stay with me for a long time, then you would've stayed with me. *scratches Oski's belly again* Now leave me alone.

Oski: *squeaks in pleasure* Thank you Tree-senpai!

Tree: That's more like it. Now stop following me. *leaves again*

Oski: Oh no, not again! *follows Tree once more*

Tree: Dammit, just stay there. *walks around Sproul Plaza area*

Oski: It's a little hard for me to do that. I want to be with you Tree-senpai!

Tree: I don't care what you say, you little goof. Just go away already. *leaves yet again*

Oski: You are a bad senpai Tree-senpai! T-T *looks around Sproul Plaza for Tree, trying to find him*

Tree: *still walking around the Sproul Plaza area* If I don't finish what I need to do before nightfall, then that will ruin my opportunity of winning the Big Game tomorrow! And Oski could help me win it! This time, I've got to win. No matter what it takes...even if it's with using Oski. *smirking and chuckles*

Oski: *hears Tree's evil chuckles from a distance*

Tree: *sees Oski still walking around Sproul Plaza* Just give up already. And stop following me. I'm sick of it.

Oski: *walks over to Tree, still being stubborn* I just want to be with you Tree-senpai... *sighs*

Tree: *grinning evilly* Yeah, well I have better things to do then to stay with an annoying mascot like you.

Oski: Well that makes me sad Tree-senpai. *pouts*

Tree: Whatever, I'll see you tomorrow at the Big Game Oski. We will see who will be the winner and who will lose! And tomorrow is your last chance! You are a loser for losing this game and when I win, I'll be the greatest mascot in all the world! That is if I can win. And just because you're my mascot, doesn't mean anything. You can't even fly to win this for me! If you're ever gonna be able to do that, then now would be the best time! In front of a large crowd of people! You could impress them with your flying skills and score the goal for me, but alas you're just too lazy. *sarcastically* Go win me my big game tomorrow before it's too late! Be back at dusk or else you'll never find your way home again and you'll be lost forever in Berkeley where there are sharks like me with sharp teeth waiting to eat your flesh. *smirking*

Oski: D-Don't scare me like that Tree-senpai! *starts panicking* I will win for you, so please don't hurt me. *hugs Tree*

Tree: *chuckles evilly* I won't hurt you now...but if I lose tomorrow then that means you've lost as well. And you're gonna be my delicious meal and I'll savor your flesh until there is nothing left of you to eat, and just because I'm always this hungry, that means you'll need to stay with me forever.

Oski: Eeee! *scared and runs away from Tree*

Tree: *watching Oski run away from him and chuckles again* Not so fast coward. We will meet up again tomorrow at dawn in Berkeley. So don't be late or else there will be hell to pay!

Oski: *pants and still running from Tree* Aaah! I promise Tree-senpai, we'll see each other tomorrow at the Big Game. I'm sorry for being so bad but please don't hurt me! *looking around for a safer place to hide*

Tree: *still chasing after Oski and grinning evilly* You better run fast little kitty!
