This is a fanfic between Oski, the official mascot of UC Berkeley, and Tree, the mascot for Stanford. Although UC Berkeley is the number one public university in the world, Oski-chan still holds some jealousy towards Tree-senpai for being such a successful private school. The scene begins with Oski and Tree sitting together on top of The Big C in Berkeley, having a romantic conversation at sunset. Oski-chan is leaning on Tree's shoulder in the twilight.

Oski: Tree-senpai, you are such a wealthy and successful private school. Me, I'm just a poor state university.

Tree: It's okay Oski, you're also very successful. You're the most famous school mascot in the world! I know you'll achieve all the success you want. You'll be the most successful college in the world soon enough.

Oski: Really, Tree-senpai? blush You think I have potential?

Tree: Of course, Oski-chan. You are loved by many people around the world. They love you so much that you are almost as famous as me! And they never forget you, especially during football season when your face covers a large portion of the stadium and the students sing along to your dance every day.

Oski: Ooo Tree-senpai, you make me so happy! kiss

Oski-chan and Tree ontinue their sunset together, admiring the view, playing around, and sharing an intimate moment. The scene fades to black.

Little do they know that about 10,000 miles away on top of another giant oak tree is UCSC-kun. He's just watching this whole scene go down.c
