This is a fanfic between Oski, the official mascot of UC Berkeley, and Tree, the mascot for Stanford. Although UC Berkeley is the number one public university in the world, Oski-chan still holds some jealousy towards Tree-senpai for being such a successful private school. The scene begins with Oski and Tree sitting together on top of The Big C in Berkeley, having a romantic conversation at sunset. Oski-chan is leaning on Tree's shoulder in the twilight.

Oski: 'Ah, Tree, it's so beautiful up here... I don't feel like we should be hiding this from everyone.'

Tree: 'Yeah, I'm glad you said that, because I've been meaning to tell you something.'

Oski: 'Oh, Tree, you're really adorable.'

Tree: 'This is so scary, but I think I might be developing a crush on you, Oski.'

Oski: 'How adorable~ And I think I'm developing a crush on you too, Tree! â™¥'

Oski leans in to kiss Tree, but Tree moves away.

Oski: 'Tree?'

Tree: 'Well, the reason why I didn't kiss you... Is because we're rivals. Like, there are people out there who would find it annoying to know that we're attracted to each other.'

Oski: 'That's true. There are times where I don't like it when I see Tree-senpai googly-eyed over me. But I really can't help myself. Let's be open about this; I'm ready to take the heat.'

Tree: 'I agree. It'll be awkward to hide this from everyone.'

Oski grabs Tree and forcefully brings him closer to Oski for a kiss. Oski continues to kiss Tree until an earthquake occurs. The two separate from each other in order to prevent falling off the building.

Tree: 'Maybe we should wait until we've taken this slow for a bit longer before we confess our love for each other?'

Oski: 'Good idea. We don't want anyone ruining this for us... Especially from people who claim to be our friends.'

Tree: 'Right. But for now, let's just enjoy our time up here and forget about the people who don't matter.'

Oski: 'Sounds great!'

Oski leans in to kiss Tree again.

- the end.
